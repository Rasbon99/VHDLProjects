# Exercise 5.1
Design, implement in VHDL, and test through simulation a stopwatch capable of marking seconds, minutes, and hours starting from a predetermined time base (e.g., consider the clock available on the board). The project must provide the ability to initialize the stopwatch with an initial value, always expressed in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds, through an appropriate set input, and must provide a reset input to zero the time.
The component must be realized using a structural approach, properly connecting counters according to a chosen scheme.
