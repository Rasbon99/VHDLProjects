# Exercise 1.3
This project involves synthesizing and implementing the ROM+M system on the Nexys A7 100T board. The system was initially developed in section 2.1. The implementation utilizes switches to specify the address of the ROM from which values are to be read for transformation. The 4-bit output is then displayed using LEDs.
