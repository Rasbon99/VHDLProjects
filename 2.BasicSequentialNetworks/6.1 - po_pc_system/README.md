# Exercise 6.1
Design, implement in VHDL, and verify through simulation a system equipped with a ROM memory of N 8-bit locations, a combinatorial machine M capable of transforming (according to a function chosen by the student) the 8-bit string read from the ROM into a 4-bit string, and a MEM memory of N locations that stores the output string from M. The system starts upon receiving an external START signal. Once started, through a suitable control unit that manages the systemâ€™s timing, one ROM location at a time is scanned and the corresponding MEM location is written. The memory addresses are provided by a counter. The ROM and MEM memories respectively have a synchronous read and write.
