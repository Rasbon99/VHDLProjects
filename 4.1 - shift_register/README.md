# Exercise 4.1
Design, implement in VHDL, and test through simulation an N-bit shift register capable of shifting to the right or left by a variable number Y of positions, depending on a suitable selection. In particular, the possible values for Y are 1 and 2. The user, through selection, should choose the number of positions to shift. The component must be realized using both a) behavioral approach and b) structural approach.

Note: The number of bits in the register must be implemented as a generic, and the operating mode should be selectable externally through appropriate selection signals.
