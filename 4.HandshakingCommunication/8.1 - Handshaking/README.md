# Exercise 8.1
Design, implement in VHDL, and test through simulation a system composed of 2 nodes, A and B, that communicate using a handshaking protocol. Both node A and node B have internal memory where N strings of M bits are stored, named X(i) and Y(i) respectively (i=0,â€¦,N-1). Node A transmits each string X(i) to B using a handshaking protocol; B, upon receiving the string X(i), calculates S(i)=X(i)+Y(i) and stores the sum in appropriate locations of its own internal memory. For the project, it is possible to consider a behavioral implementation to perform the sum, while it is necessary to explicitly provide a counter component in both system A and system B to scan the transmission/reception of the strings and to terminate the communication.
