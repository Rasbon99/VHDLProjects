# Exercise 10
Starting from the implementation provided by Digilent of a UART-RS232 device (component RS232RefComp.vhd), design, implement and simulate in VHDL a system composed of 2 units A and B that share the same clock signal and communicate with each other through a serial interface. System A contains a ROM of 8 locations of 1 byte each, a counter CONT_A to scan the locations of the ROM and a UART_A, while system B contains a memory MEM of 8 locations of 1 byte each, a counter CONT_B to scan the locations of the MEM and a UART_B. When a WR signal is asserted in unit A, a byte is taken from the ROM and sent to unit B, which must receive it and save it in MEM.
